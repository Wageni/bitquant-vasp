\section{Special considerations for small companies}

Large companies can insure institutionalizing by separating roles into
several different people, but there is limited ability to do this with
SME's.  Our goal is to insure good governance by making sure that the
interests of senior management are aligned with those of the clients,
and to use the use of technology to provide oversight.
