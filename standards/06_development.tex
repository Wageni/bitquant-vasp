\section{Token admission policy}
Tokens will be added onto the exchange only upon the recommendation of
an independent token admission board.  This exchange will work with
other exchanges to insure that any new tokens are issued
simulatenously on several exchanges.

We shall inform the Securities and Futures Commission if we are
considering any new tokens under consideration.

We will work with other exchanges and regulators to develop standards
for the issuance of new tokens, particularly tokens of a securities
nature.  We will not require tokens to sign any exclusive listing
tokens.  Our fees for issuing tokens will be limited to the
administrative costs of adding new tokens and we will not turn token
listing into a profit center.
