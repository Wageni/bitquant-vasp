- Key vendor risk
-- Companies can be dependent on key vendors (google, github)
-- Company should list all of their vendors and what happens if a vendor goes down
-- In some cases, the vendor has a lock on a system, but this is information that is 
valuable for the regulator to identify systemic risks (i.e. if everyone has their e-mail
on google what happens if google goes down)
