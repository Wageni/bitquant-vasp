\section{Deposit process}
The deposit process consists of the user sending tokens into the
deposit wallet, and then the system moving tokens from the deposit
wallet into the accumulator wallet.  The trading system will generate
the keys of the deposit wallets, and these keys are stored encrypted
in the database.

The private keys of the accumultator wallet are available only with
the a senior manager, and should not be stored on the trading
platform.  Copies of the private keys of the accumulator should be
stored split in two and stored in the archvial location.

\section{Withdrawal process}

The withdrawal process consists of several steps.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Funds are moved from the cold wallets to the hot wallets and
    made available for withdrawal.  Typically this transfer should be
    made once per day and should consist of 120 percent of the average
    expected delay withdrawal volume.
  \item Withdrawals are approved by a staff member
  \item Withdrawals are then queued by the hot wallet and approve by a manager
\end{itemize}
