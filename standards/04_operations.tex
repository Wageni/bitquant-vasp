\chapter{Operations}
\section{Account acceptance}

The types of accounts that we expect to open can be classified as:

\begin{itemize}
\item Retail accounts
  \item Corporate accounts
\item Financial intermediaries
\item Staff accounts
  \end{itemize}

Our main clients are expected

\subsection{KYC}

\subsection{Financial intermediaries}
We consider licensed financial intermediaries including money services
operators, family offices, and license brokers to be low risk,
provided that they are licensed in a reputable jurisdiction such as
Hong Kong, Singapore, and Dubai.  It is our expectation that a
licensed financial intermediary would maintain adequate AML/KYC
protections to satisfy their regulators and hence it would be
unnecessary for us to add an additional level of AML/KYC.

Our main concern regarding due dilligence regarding financial
intermediaries is that they are who they say they are, and that they
the information that the provide is accurate.  In onboarding a
financial intermediary, the staff will check to see that the
intermediary is in fact licensed and that the person opening the
account is an authorized agent of the intermediary.  The staff will
monitor the intermediary with ongoing checks to make sure that there
has been no enforcement action taken.

\subsection{No cross-exchange, vostro, nostro accounts}
The company will not maintain an account with another exchange nor
allow another exchange to hold an account with the company, and will
not maintain nostro or vostro accounts.  Our main concern is that
cross exchange accounts will create ``hidden leverage'' in the
financial system and will cause leverage

\subsection{No third party trading for non-FI accounts}
Persons who are not financial intermediaries are not permitted to
trade on the exchange on behalf of third parties.

\section{Deposit process}
The deposit process consists of the user sending tokens into the
deposit wallet, and then the system moving tokens from the deposit
wallet into the accumulator wallet.  The trading system will generate
the keys of the deposit wallets, and these keys are stored encrypted
in the database.

The private keys of the accumultator wallet are available only with
the a senior manager, and should not be stored on the trading
platform.  Copies of the private keys of the accumulator should be
stored split in two and stored in the archvial location.

\section{Withdrawal process}

The withdrawal process consists of several steps.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Funds are moved from the cold wallets to the hot wallets and
    made available for withdrawal.  Typically this transfer should be
    made once per day and should consist of 120 percent of the average
    expected delay withdrawal volume.
  \item Withdrawals are approved by a staff member
  \item Withdrawals are then queued by the hot wallet and approve by a manager
\end{itemize}

    and handle suspicious trading activity.  Staff will also be given
    compliance training concerning ``anti-tipping'' procedures and
    that any suspicious activity should not be raised with the client.
  \item In case, staff believes that there is a compliance issue that
    can be addressed by senior management then will be a hotline that
    will allow the staff to raise the issue with compliance

    with the financial regulators or law enforcement in case they
    believe that the issue cannot be resolved within the firm.  Staff

    which any profits made by personal trading are subject to
    ``clawback'' in case the firm folds
